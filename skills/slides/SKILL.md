description: Generate high-quality HTML slide presentations with beautiful templates. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions slides, presentation, PPT, deck, keynote, 演示文稿, or 幻灯片 — even if they don't explicitly ask for HTML or templates. This skill handles both polished multi-template workflows and fast self-contained themes. Use it for any request involving creating, building, or generating a presentation regardless of how the request is phrased.

# Interactive HTML Slide Generator

## Two Workflows

This skill supports **two workflows**:

- **Workflow A — Beautiful HTML Templates** (recommended): 32 professionally-designed templates. Best for polished, visually distinctive decks. Asks about occasion and mood, presents 3 candidates, builds from real template HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Workflow B — Built-in CSS Themes**: 4 CSS themes (Cyberpunk, Corporate, Minimal, Nature). Fast, self-contained single-file output, no external dependencies.

**Default to Workflow A** unless the user explicitly asks for a specific theme or wants a minimal/lightweight output.

---

## Workflow A — Beautiful HTML Templates (Recommended)

### Step 1 — Clarify Taste

Ask the user two questions before picking any template:

> "Two quick questions before I pick a template:
> 1. **What's the occasion?** (e.g. product launch, research talk, brand manifesto, classroom, team review, etc.)
> 2. **What mood / vibe do you want?** (e.g. confident & editorial, warm & playful, dark & moody, quiet & literary, etc.)"

Wait for the user's answer. Do not skip this — the user's stated taste reveals what no inferred brief can.

### Step 2 — Read index.json and Shortlist 3 Candidates

Read `skills/ppt/beautiful-html-templates/index.json`. Match the user's stated **occasion + mood** against each template's `mood`, `tone`, `formality`, `density`, and `scheme` fields.

Pick **three templates** whose tones genuinely fit and are *different enough* from each other (e.g., don't pick three editorial templates — pick one editorial, one warmer alternative, and one wildcard).

### Step 3 — Build Title-Slide Previews of Each Candidate

For each of the 3 candidates:

1. Read `skills/ppt/beautiful-html-templates/templates/<slug>/template.html`
2. Extract **the first slide only** (the cover/title slide)
3. Replace placeholder content with **the user's actual topic/title/subtitle/author/date**
4. Save as `slides/<ppt-name>/previews/01-<slug>.html`

Open each preview with `open <path>` (macOS) and send the user a message:

> "Three options to compare:
> 1. **<Template A>** — <one-line tone description>
>    `/path/to/previews/01-template-a.html`
> 2. **<Template B>** — <one-line tone description>
>    `/path/to/previews/02-template-b.html`
> 3. **<Template C>** — <one-line tone description>
>    `/path/to/previews/03-template-c.html`
>
> Which one feels right?"

Wait for the user to pick.

### Step 4 — Build the Full Deck

Once the user picks:

1. Read `skills/ppt/beautiful-html-templates/templates/<slug>/template.html` in full
2. Adapt every slide per the rules in [AGENTS.md](./beautiful-html-templates/AGENTS.md) §3 — preserve the design system, replace placeholder content
3. Add/remove/split slides to match the user's content outline
4. **If a layout is missing**, design it using the template's fonts, color palette, decorative vocabulary, and spacing rhythm — see [AGENTS.md](./beautiful-html-templates/AGENTS.md) §5
5. Ensure the navigation (keyboard/click) works correctly
6. Save the final deck as `slides/<ppt-name>/dist/index.html`

### Step 5 — Open and Deliver

Open the final deck with `open <path>`. Send:

> "Done. Your deck is at `/path/to/deck/index.html` — opened in your browser."

## Workflow B — Built-in CSS Themes (Fallback)

Use this when the user wants a specific theme or a self-contained minimal output.

### Theme Selection

| Theme | Style | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Cyberpunk** | Dark, neon, futuristic | Default — tech, gaming, innovation |
| **Corporate** | Light, professional, blue/slate | Business, formal reports |
| **Minimal** | Black & white, Swiss style | Academic, stark, editorial |
| **Nature** | Cream/green, elegant serif | Warm, organic, literary |

**Default to Cyberpunk** if no theme is specified.

### Assembly Process

1. **Read reference files**: the selected CSS theme + `templates/template.html` + `templates/scripts.js` + `templates/layouts.md`
2. **Load Template**: Start with `template.html`
3. **Inject CSS**: Replace `/* CSS_INJECTION_POINT */` with the selected theme CSS
4. **Inject JS**: Replace `/* JS_INJECTION_POINT */` with `scripts.js`, then replace `[TOTAL_SLIDES_COUNT]` with the actual number
5. **Generate Slides**: Create HTML using patterns from `layouts.md`
6. **Inject Slides**: Replace `<!-- SLIDES_INJECTION_POINT -->`
7. **Save**: `slides/<ppt-name>/dist/index.html`

## Overflow Prevention (Workflow B)

Slides are fixed **1280×720px**. Overflow is hidden and will clip content silently.

| Element | Max | If Exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| Bullets | **5** | Split into 2 slides |
| Cards | **3** | Use `.compact` or split |
| Code lines | **10** | Use `.scrollable` on content-area |
| Card body | 2 lines | Shorten |

**Rules**:
- Max 5 bullets per slide, each max 1-2 lines
- Max 3 cards per grid slide
- Never stack bullets + cards + code on the same slide
- Use `.compact` class to reduce font sizes and spacing
- Prefer splitting over cramming
